<!-- insert image of people above png or jpg -->

  ## Description
  I was tasked with creating an interface that makes it easy for non-developers to view and interact with employee information stored in databases. My challenge in making this Content Management System (CMS) was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
